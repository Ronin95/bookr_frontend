In this react code I have programmed the frontend to my full-stack bookr project.
The frontend displays the Login / Register capability that is connected to the Bookr Django Backend.
Then it features the Library where the user can upload PDF files and read them.
Further it has the tools.
Those tools are PDF Chat, AI Web Search and AI Agent.
PDF Chat allows you to start a Chat conversation with your files.
AI Web Search seaches wikipedia, duckduckgo and exa search for whatever input you insert into.
And AI Agent (altough still experimental) works by you giving it an objective, it creates To Do Steps and then summarizes the result.
Last but not least it hast a Kanban Management, where a user can create Notes, Edit them and move them
around on the Kanban.

I have even created a video for you <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/d0f86428a00a4cb794971be60ae4d1f5?sid=55f4c09b-4dc2-4890-b118-adb75d36238e">here</a> where you can view the project.
I hope you enjoyed it and leave feedback.

Thank you.
